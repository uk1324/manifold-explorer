Could have a CAS console.

Could have an argument into simplify that would record the domain of the expression. For example whenever there is a negative power it would assert that the base is nonzero.

The symbolic differentiation of ln(x) -> 1/x has a larger domain than the original function. Technically 1/x is the derivative of ln(|x|). This can also be interpreted as the analytic continutation of the derivative of ln(x)

Also you can define one sided derivatives in the function is defined on a closed set.

let m = sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 - 1
mm^(-1) gets simplified to 1 by most systems. Which is a correct transformation on the domain the expression is defined that is on the empty set.

Are there any operations that produce incorrect results because of domains.
One example might be differentation. If the derivative is defined only on open sets the the derivative of a function defined on a closed set is undefined on the boundary.

In integration integrals might be different based on wether expressions are equal. For example
sin(nx) is not always -1/n cos(nx), because n can be zero. n could be replaced with m (where m has a different variable than x).

x^k when k = -1 is also wrong

Also 
solving
sin(x) = a
doesn't just give
x = arcsin(a)

In sympy
Things like arcsin(sin(x)) don't get automatically simplified but when using solve for 
arcsin(sin(x)) it gives only [0]

TODO: Write the rewrite rules inside the functions implementing them


((-1)^2)^(1/2) = (1)^(1/2)
(-1)^(2 * (1/2)) = (-1)^1 = -1

a is real
(a^(1/2))^2 = (a^2)^(1/2)
because the expression a^(1/2) is only defined for non negative a

One issue with using domains for computation is that the numerical computation of a simplified form of the domain expression might evaluate to a different value. Then the function will be undefined at 2 points instead of one for example.

I guess if the function isn't too weird then the function would be undefined for a range of floating point numbers around the point.

Also you can have both x > 0 and x < 0 as the domain assumptions which are contradictory.
Is this really an issue. If you simplify an expression and it turns out to be undefined one some region then it still should be correct.

Another issue is the order of operations. If you have an expression like (x^2)^(1/2) x^(1/2) then if you simplify left to right you wont notice the domain is actually x > 0

For solving inequalitites the monoticity of functions can be used.
