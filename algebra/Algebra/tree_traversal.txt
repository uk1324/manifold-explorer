In this application most of the time you want to first apply a transformation to the child nodes and only after transform the current node.
Should things happen like this.

Visit node
Apply all transformations sequentially to each subnodes 
Apply all transformations to current node

or

Visit each node and apply one transformation
Visit each node and apply other transformation 
and so on

I think the second option is wrong, because it might miss some optimization on a single pass.
if you were to apply.
